    A database is a systematic collection of data which support storage and manipulation of data in a easy way. Example: a telephone directory is a database for the 
    telephone numbers.

Question 3: --> Why do you think a Database is needed?

    * A database is needed because while doing data entry files in a spreadsheet like excel, it becomes difficult to manage the accuracy as there are no 
    validations present in it.
    * Manual validation of thousands of entries and verification are near impossible to do efficiently.
    * With the database, there is flexibility to update the data as per convenience. Multiple people can also edit data at same time which is a big plus
    * The data is less secure in spreadsheets which makes it easy for anyone to easily access the files and can make changes. With databases
    you are provided with security groups and privileges that you can set to restrict access
    
Question 4: --> What is a DBMS? Name some of the common DBMS.
    
    DBMS is abbrevated as DataBase Management System. It is actually a set of programs that are used to view and manipate the data in the database.

Question 5: --> What is the difference between SQL and NoSQL?

    SQL-
        $ The type of Database SQL handles is relational database.
        $ The structed data are stored in the form of tables with Instances and Records.
        $ The online data sharing is excellent.
        $ The database are in compliance with the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties.
    NOSQL-
        $ The type of Database NOSQL handles is non-relational database.
        $ The unstructed data are stored in the JSON file format.
        $ The online data sharing is considered average compared with SQL.
        $ The database are in compliance with the CAP (Consistency, Availability & Partition Tolerance) theorem
